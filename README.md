\* There is no way to remove your landing page other than putting up a literal 'Out of Business' sign. The landing page is created without your consent upon signing up for the app and Homestars grants itself a perpetual licence to your business name which will show up on google search results. Traces of even clearly fraudulent reviews are maintained in perpetuity, implying strongarm tactics and bullying of negative reviewers
