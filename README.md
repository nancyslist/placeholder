\* There is no way to remove your landing page from Homestars other than putting up a literal 'Out of Business' sign. The landing page is created without your consent and without warning upon signing up for the app and Homestars grants itself a perpetual licence to your business name which will show up in Google search results forever. Traces of even clearly fraudulent reviews are maintained in perpetuity, implying strongarm tactics and bullying of negative reviewers. Only paid users may add a logo or otherwise customize the user experience

### Payments
Contractors always get paid. Customers never get ripped off

Payments are held in an Escrow account and are released to the contractor only upon reaching certain documented goals. Deposits are not permitted unless a contractor is fully verified. All deposits must be approved by Nancy's List
